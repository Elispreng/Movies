# Overview 
The project uses a movie database to explore what are successful movies?

# Data
For this project, I have been requested to extract information from the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) and TMDB (The Movie Database) in order to analyze what makes a movie successful.

The data was extracted using API yelp for 2020 and 2021. Working with Coding Dojo also included access to additional years of data.
