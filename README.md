 Updated Dojo Project

 ### Under Construction

# Overview 
The project uses a movie database to explore what are successful movies?

# Data
For this project, I have been requested to extract information from the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) and TMDB (The Movie Database) in order to analyze what makes a movie successful.

# Project Stages and Deliverables
1. Preparing Data and creating 3 files (title basics, ratings, and aka). These files are a  great sources  that includes details about revenue, budget, genres, runtime, and titles.
2.  Creating a API yelp data extraction and exploratory data analysis.
  - Create 4 filtered databases initally.
      - Movie-Production-Business-Analysis repository
    - title_basics.csv.gz
    - title_akas.csv.gz
    - title_ratings.csv.gz
3. Combined movie  data file
4.  Prepare movie data base for SQL and created usable tables
     - title_basics
     - title_ratings
     - title_genres
     - genres
     - tmdb_data
5.  Hypothesis Testing and Visuals
     - Does the MPAA rating of a movie affect how much revenue the movie generates?
     - Did 2018 films generate more revenue than 2020?
     - Do movies that are over 2.5 hours have a significantly different revenue than movies that under 1.5 hours in length?
     - Does the genre of a movie affect how much revenue a movie generates?
6.  Extract Data from SQL to Tableau
- working
